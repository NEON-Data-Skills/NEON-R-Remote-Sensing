## About
* Exploring Spatial patterns in Lidar Data: histograms,
* Summarizing lidar data: binary binning/thresholding, etc.

## R Skills Level
Intermediate (link to other group's lessons)

### Background

## Learning Objectives
* (C) understand the measurement and where it comes from
  point cloud to raster concepts (gridding): Creation of products (DTM,
    CSM,
  CHM) imaging/data collect; tabular data
* (C) ecology of canopy height (what information does it give us that is
  useful?) what does gridded height imply? how itâ€™s different (and the
    same)
  from field data what might variation in CHM show?
* (T) Plot the study area (geotiff 1 km sq file) and explore pixel values
colors transect
* (T) Overlay and extract 2 study regions
* (T) Display the 2 regions
* (T) Create and threshold histograms in the two regions
* (T) More advanced analysis: spatial pattern using standard deviation/moving window (only doing this for chm, not hyperspectral)

### R libraries
* `raster`
* `rgdal`
* `rhdf5`

``` {r}
install.packages('raster')
install.packages('rgdal')
install.packages('rhdf5')

library('raster')
library('rgdal')
library('rhdf5')
```
